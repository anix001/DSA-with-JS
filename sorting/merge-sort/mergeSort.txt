Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. 
It is based on the divide-and-conquer strategy. 
Merge sort continuously cuts down a list into multiple sublists until each has only one item, 
then merges those sublists into a sorted list.

T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n) The solution of the above recurrence is O(nLogn).
